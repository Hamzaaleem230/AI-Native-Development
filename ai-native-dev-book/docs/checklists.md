# AID Production Checklists 📋

Before launching any AI feature, following checklists ensure **quality, reliability, and safety**. Each step is important to avoid errors, hallucinations, and deployment failures. ⚡

---

## ✔️ Pre-Development Planning 🧩

Before writing any code or training models, ensure you have:

- **Defined Problem Clearly** 🎯  
  - What problem is being solved?  
  - Who is the target user?  
  - Expected outcome defined?  
  *Example:* Automate customer support response generation.  

- **Data Availability** 📊  
  - Raw data sources identified  
  - Data quality checked (duplicates, missing values)  
  - Compliance with privacy policies ✅  

- **Risks Identified** ⚠️  
  - Ethical considerations  
  - Potential bias in data  
  - Security vulnerabilities  

- **Model Selected** 🧠  
  - LLM or ML model chosen based on task  
  - Baseline performance evaluated  
  - Licensing and cost considerations  

**Tips:**  
- Document assumptions clearly 📝  
- Create a diagram of data flow and model usage 🔄

## ✔️ Development Stage 🛠️

During development, focus on **experiments, testing, and validation**:

- **Experiments Documented** 🔬  
  - Task definitions logged  
  - Model parameters recorded  
  - Dataset versions noted  

- **Evaluation Metrics Passed** 📊  
  - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
  - Latency and throughput for performance tasks  
  - User satisfaction metrics if applicable  

- **Edge Cases Tested** ⚡  
  - Unusual inputs  
  - Empty or malformed data  
  - Boundary conditions  

- **Code & Model Reviews Done** 🧐  
  - Peer review for code  
  - Model output sanity checks  
  - Security review completed  

- **Version Control Managed** 🔧  
  - Git branches structured  
  - Commits descriptive  
  - Checkpoints for models  

**Tips:**  
- Use **automated unit tests** 🧪  
- Keep **short iteration loops** 🔁  
- Document lessons learned after each experiment 📚

## ✔️ Deployment & Production 🚀

Before going live, confirm **monitoring, safety, and rollback strategies**:

- **Monitoring Enabled** 👀  
  - Real-time tracking of system health  
  - AI output metrics recorded  
  - Alerting for anomalies  

- **Logging & Tracing Active** 📝  
  - Track input/output pairs  
  - Log errors, warnings, and exceptions  
  - Ensure privacy and security compliance  

- **Rollback Strategy Ready** 🔄  
  - Can revert to previous stable model/version  
  - Database backups available  
  - Deployment scripts tested  

- **Safeguards Against Hallucination** ⚡  
  - Output validation for accuracy  
  - Safety filters for sensitive content  
  - Human-in-the-loop for critical decisions  

- **Performance Benchmarks Met** 🏁  
  - Response time acceptable  
  - Resource usage within limits  
  - Scalability tested  

- **Documentation Complete** 📄  
  - README updated  
  - Usage instructions clear  
  - Known limitations listed  

- **Team Communication Ready** 🤝  
  - Notify stakeholders about go-live  
  - Provide contact for incidents  
  - Post-deployment support plan in place  

---

## ✔️ Post-Deployment Checks 🔍

- **User Feedback Collected** 💬  
  - Surveys or usage analytics  
  - Report issues or errors  

- **Metrics Monitored Continuously** 📊  
  - Model accuracy drift  
  - System latency and errors  
  - Resource utilization  

- **Maintenance Plan Established** 🛠️  
  - Scheduled retraining of model  
  - Regular audits for bias and fairness  
  - Update monitoring thresholds  

- **Incident Response Plan** 🚨  
  - Who to contact in case of failure  
  - Automated rollback triggers  
  - Communication templates ready  

**Tips:**  
- Keep **checklists living** – update after every major release 🔄  
- Combine with AI tools to auto-verify steps ✅  
- Celebrate milestones 🎉
