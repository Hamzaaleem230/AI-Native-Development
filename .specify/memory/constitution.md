# Docusaurus Book/Documentation Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Content-First
Documentation prioritizes clear, accurate, and comprehensive content. Every page must serve a specific user need and be kept up-to-date.

### II. Structured Navigation
Navigation must be intuitive and consistent, enabling users to easily find information. This includes a clear table of contents and logical linking between pages and chapters.

### III. Markdown Portability
All content must be authored in standard Markdown format, ensuring easy export, transferability, and future-proofing across different platforms.

### IV. Chapter-Based Organization
Content is organized into logical chapters, each with a defined scope. Chapters facilitate modularity and allow for a clear progression of topics.

### V. Maintainability
The documentation project must be easy to update, maintain, and extend. This includes clear file structures, consistent styling, and minimal technical debt.

## Content Standards

*   All content must adhere to Docusaurus Markdown conventions.
*   Code examples must be accurate, tested, and syntax-highlighted.
*   Images and media must be optimized for web performance and accessibility.

## Development Workflow

*   New content and updates require peer review.
*   Changes must be tested locally before submission.
*   Build process must pass without warnings or errors.

## Governance
Amendments to this constitution require a documented proposal, team consensus, and a plan for migration if changes are backward-incompatible. Compliance with these principles will be periodically reviewed.
